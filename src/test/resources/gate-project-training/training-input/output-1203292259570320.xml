    <text>I have to say that in many, many ways I'm really disappointed.  The "big" elements in this had great potential--but as they say, the devil is in the details and I think Bioware fails completely on that score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Combat - The combat on a larger scale is great--its smoother and more fluid.  You can do things more rapidly.  On the downside, your characters are very much "locked" into their roles and depending on what you start out with you--you can end up totally stuck.  For example--unless you are a mage, the only person who can be a true healer is Anders.  You can't do the "revive a party member" or "group heal" without him or without being a mage yourself. You also are going to lose some characters (if not indefinitely) at least for certain stretches of the game and you can miss a couple of them if you don't do every random "secondary" quest.  My first go round I had ONE non-ranged melee character--ONE for a huge portion of the game.  God bless Aveline but I've never been a fan of sword and shield so she got boring after awhile.  The only rogue you have access to that isn't an archer is Isabela and she's problematic later on in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Armor -- My first playthrough I made the mistake of not actually reading the stupid booklet that came with the game and it took me forever to realize that about 75% of the armor is useless and any armor you pick up can only be used on your character.  That makes looting so much less fun and finding the random upgrade slots for your characters is incredibly anti-climactic.  I think this was laziness on the programming side--Bioware probably didn't want to have to adjust all the cutscenes to show your characters in the various armor.  That shortcut took a lot out of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The Interface -- oh sweet jesus do I HATE the ability trees.  They are so annoying and it takes forever to navigate through them and compare things.  Were the solid straightforward squares just too easy for us that Bioware had to make it more confusing for no apparent reason?  I also find the inventory as not all that much improved.  There is just less stuff to hold onto because of the aforementioned armor issue.  I really would have loved an interface that lets you see (and distribute) gear to all your characters at once--not just people in your party--or at least see what you have equipped on all your characters even if they weren't in your group at the time.  This would have been a huge improvement and made it easier to choose what charms to sell or hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Environment. -- All the caves, mansions, tunnels--they all look exactly the same.  The only difference in one cave to another is that it will allow you to open X door and then not Y door.  It's very hard to stay interested in the environment when you spend almost all the game in one city.  They should have taken a little more time to put in a few details here and there in the different settings to set them apart.  Maybe just change the coloring of the walls or some of the layout.  You also spend a lot of time just walking from point A to point B and I hate having to visit every character in their own "home base".  The game lost a lot in not having a place where you could have all the characters come together--like the camp from Origins.  I think the game would have benefited greatly from having a sort of meeting place for the characters--like the pub.  It would have opened up lots of interactions and interesting gameplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Characters and Dialogue.  Death to the conversation wheel!  Death!  I hate the fact that what you choose has only a vague resemblance to what you actually say.  And while the stupid little picture gives you a clue--the tone is often questionable.  What was wrong with Origins dialogue?  You choose something and...gasp...you actually say that.  I completely miss the gifts option--it was sort of like a mini game and it really helped you understand the companions' personalities and gave them another dimension.  I'm on my second playthrough and I still don't quite have a lock on some of the personality preferences.  I also think Bioware really skimped on the romance cutscenes and options.  I'm still angry on how poorly they wrote Anders.  While he has every reason to be very "changed" from Awakenings, there's almost none of the light-hearted guy who carried "Ser-Pounce-A-Lot" around.  If you played Awakenings, you'd expect Anders to like the funny dialogue options, even if he's all tortured and nuts...but he doesn't.  I don't see the point in bringing characters from the previous lore if you are going to disregard their history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  The story.  Ah, the story as a whole--the big picture *could* be interesting and compelling--it *could* have been epic.  And it should have involved lots and lots of magic.  But alas, no.  The problem is that the quests never come together and there are tons of missed opportunities.  There really aren't any epic quests (although you fight dragons frequently enough that you'll get bored with them).  The one quest that stands out involves Hawke's mother which is the most interesting (and personal) of the entire game.  It has a big tie in at at the end but only if you pay intense attention.  Just playing up that angle alone would have made the game extremelymore personal. The quests and character interaction don't even have a shadow of the richness as those in the first game.  Bioware also went a little overboard with trying to force concepts to seem "gray" because some plot points came across as illogical and extremely ill-fitting.  Characters don't behave logically nor do people behave particularly logically toward you. There will come a time where you really don't feel like either side deserves your help.  Not the outcome you want after hours of gameplay and certainly not one that makes you feel anything like a "champion".</text>
