    <text>Lots of reviewers here will have played the original game. They loved it to death, most of them(I cringed when I had to defeat a dragon when I first began but the politics, 'choice realism' and emotional impact helped make it so much more believable). It's like their first relationship. They are so stuck with what they like about the first game that when Bioware says the second is getting a different approach, it's as if they heard 'yes we will never be different for any reason'. On the other hand there's nothing I can say that justifies Bioware's decision to rush it. Now they want to break up with the franchise. If you haven't played Dragon Age: Origins and you want to play this first, you are indeed fortunate, because DA:O doesn't do anything to prepare you for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let's get to the main point: worth buying BUT not before you accept that it's not meant to be the DA:O you played before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some general things reviewers on a lot of websites have been saying and my counterpoints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Story approach and pacing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers would say: I hate that there's no clear objective in DA2, I'm just moving from one meaningless quest to the next! DA:O had that! Only the last act made sense! I got epilogues in DA:O why the hell not in here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) My counterpoint: From what I see, this Bioware team has got some people who are extremely gifted in the subtlety of storytelling and I mean that as a compliment. Before I go into the rest of this section I want to state that this game is as rich in story subtlety as the last one if not richer. It has so much going on at one time that it will be sometime before you can keep up with the pacing. It will get better once you begin playing the second time around, you will begin to see how the plot was right there from the start. Sure it took awhile to begin unfolding it but it made that 2nd play through all the more sweeter. Remember to explore everyone, everything, everywhere at every stage of the game. Don't rush yourselves through this or you will lose out important bits of "non-quest" info that shape the story profoundly. This will be like getting a new 'acquired taste'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the idea of a 7 year account of my character in just one city as told by an interrogated dwarf sounded cheesy to me before the release. But I noticed from the first playthrough that Bioware took painstaking effort in crafting out the options of a poor Fereldan refugee trying to make it in a city with a slave driven past. Once you accept that as part of the overall game design, then it will cease to be such a major pain. Most people will complain about the dialogue options being dumbed down but they don't know that you can get away with lying and end up getting someone jobless because of it (and this someone then makes an interesting reappearance towards the end of the game). Only one disappointment in the story towards the end but not enough to turn you off completely from finishing it once. Also one group that keeps attacking you randomly was left out of the story. I was expecting the game to be a lot worse than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just let go of DA:O baggage I bet you will get excited for the next one. The last cameo in the final cutscene was something I found especially masterful. I cannot believe that I have to be waiting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Level Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers would say: So repetitive and boring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) My counterpoint: I don't have much of one. You will be going to one particular location over and over again and it has winding paths everywhere. I got really sick and tired that the map couldn't scroll or be resized to help me see my plot marker more clearly. Then there are series of levels that look like the same one you have seen before in earlier quests. Definitely one of the casualties of a shortened development timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Companions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers: Boring, too linear, shallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Counterpoint: Depends on whether you are still carrying DA:O baggage with you into this game or not. From the way I see it, they are already driven by their own convictions and have their own pasts to deal with and these add to the richness of the game. They resemble a lot of us jaded, hardened adults. This is a game where the character has to pick a side when both sides clearly have their own hypocritical aspects. Most people won't like having to do so when the option to be absolutely neutral is not given. However, the story of this game is to show how a conflict in one city is impacting the rest of the world a la prequel for the 3rd installment. Once you get that into your head, it will be more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Battle, armor and potion/rune making&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers: Stupid Bioware left out my tactical window. Made battles too nice looking, as in not worth counting. Hate the new inability to switch companion armor. Hate the new crafting choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Counterpoint: I side with all the frustrated and hurt people who did not get to keep the tactical battle view. Though the new tactical view is suffient, it's just by a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I would consider the battle to be a visual improvement stylewise. Morrigan and Wynne were always doing the same one or two poses for every spell I used. The mages fighting style with their staffs still looks a little cheesy in one or two aspects but the rest are between 'over the top but it grows on me' to 'yeah nicer than DA:O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability tree has been redesigned for mostly better because it now includes abilities just for your companions, and reliant on your relationship with them. I also like that some abilities from DA:O like Sunder Armor and Sunder Arms have been simplified to just Sunder. And I find that the ability upgrades make point spending here interesting. I think spell combos are no longer part of this; I miss not having it like last time. I like how persuasion has been left up to the character's dialogue choices so that you can focus on spending points on your fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who liked the "Andraste Bridge" puzzle of DA:O will be disappointed to know its all hack and slash meet ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The companion armor is something of a convenience for me (I'm lazy that way). The ones they have from the middle of the game onwards are better than the ones sold in the stores. Miss seeing how different armor makes the characters look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i find making potions and runes in this game more convenient than before. I don't have to go and pick every hundred raw ingredients that will only add weight to my group's inventory just to keep for future use. But I do miss being able to make traps from DA:O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: Do you fork over your cash for this or not? If you are willing to let go of what DA:O meant to you in order to give this one a chance to prove itself you could be buying the most underrated game of this year. Maybe take some time to part with your impressions of DA:O before taking this next step. You don't need to rush into this like Bioware did but it will be rewarding once you open your heart to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P/s Bioware: If you resolve to take your time with DA3 and treat your writers well, you could be making the Sid Meier's Civilization of cRPG.</text>
