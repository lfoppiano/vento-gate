    <text>I'm not sure if anyone else shares this opinion, but I just feel that Bioware RPGs are becoming less and less RPGish with time.  I still think that NVWN and KOTOR are some of the best RPGs ever made.  DAO and Mass Effect are also great games.  But it seems that the games are progressively becoming worse with every new installment.  Their games are just turning into carbon copies of eachother, simplest example is to look at the characters between ME2 and DAOII. Is there really a difference between Tali and Merril? Its almost same exact storylines but the names are different... to me that just shows laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this game goes, the few things that really bothered me:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Why cant it have been set in the same place immediately after the blight? It would have been very interesting to play a game where some sort of power struggle among the survivors to be a central issue, and involving the Wardens... how they could make a DA game without wardens is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Dont think that there is a map to travel in, or different cities to visit, its ONE city with different quarters that are more or less the same.  I felt that I played the same maps OVER AND OVER AND OVER, dungeons are mostly identical and very repetitive down to the foes you face and the location you face them in.  I can count on one hand the different types of enemies... 90% of what you kill is spiders, one or two kind of deamons and skeletons, and maybe some humans who ALL dress the same out in the city nights.  The game made me feel very clausterphobic, I felt cooped up inside the walls of this one city, with very little variation in scenery.  There is no travel or a camp where all your companions can be located. I had to constantly jump from one companion home to another to interact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Loot was the worst, your companions wear their own armor so that means if you were a warrior, you will vendor 80% of the armor you find and you will never know what it looks like because your companions dont wear it!  There was really no quests in the game for any sort of special armor or weapon, I changed my armor a grand total of 3 times during the 38 hours of gametime, it went like this: Dragon armor (same one you get in the first one) to Stone-something or other set then to Champion armor... I vendored everything else that I found.  There is no smith in the game, (or none that I found) which is amazing to me that a city that HUGE has no damn shops in it, everything you buy from stalls. So there is absolutely no custom crafting in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Characters: They used the same formula of character interaction as the expansion, you cant really interact with your characters other than when you are ALLOWED to interact with them.  Most of the time I didn't want to interact because I honestly hated every follower.  Their personalities were thin, predictable and uninteresting.  There is no Leliana to sing you a sweet song, no Morrigan to break your heart, no Allistair to annoy you, yes, I actually missed Allistair (and I would have had him killed if I had an option in the first game).  They also effectively killed the romance aspect of the game, which is a shame but no big loss if they compensated for it with some interesting interactions, in which they did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The combat was stupidly simplified... I literally activated 4-5 things during combat and had 2 sustained abilities on... THATS IT.  Answer this for me please... why cant a warrior duel wield?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The ending was completely unmemorable... the Sopranos has a more meaningful ending than this game.  Unlike DAO, there was no list of consequences to your actions, so whatever decisions you made in the game, you will just have to guess as to the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other things that was wrong with this game, Im sure someone here mentioned some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no interest in buying any DLC for this game, because no matter how much glitter you put on a piece of crap, its still crap. I don't feel that any DLC will add anything of value to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed that its actually upsetting and I wont make the mistake of buying Bioware games on release dates (like I usually do) from now on.</text>
