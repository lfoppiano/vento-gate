    <text>This is a world of tyrants and corruption. This is a world of many different races, and many poor opinions to those races. This is a world of magic and demons. This is the world of the Darkspawn and the Blight. This is the world of Dragon Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Dragon Age II, sequel to the immensely popular Dragon Age Origins of 2009. Developed by BioWare of the popular Mass Effect series and the upcoming Star Wars: The Old Republic, this game aims to follow up a game whose world immersed many players who could not get enough of the politically charged world of the Origins. However there have been many differences made in the 18 month development cycle that are getting many of the hardcore fans upset. Thankfully, while many things have changed, most of them are changes for the better, and they all add up an RPG that is different from the original, yet superb on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STORY 9.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Dragon Age II follows a male or female named Hawke, a Fereldan citizen fleeing from the Blight. Because this game takes place mostly right after the events of the first game, the Blight has been defeated throughout most of the game, and therefore Darkspawn are not your primary enemies. You do still fight Darkspawn occasionally, however they are far and few between, and because of such you are mostly fighting demons and human guards, mercenaries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the first Dragon Age was based almost entirely on the world it took place in, not as much as your character you played as. The sequel negates this idea by making it take place almost entirely in one city, which is the city of Kirkwall, which makes it much more personal because you are more familiar with your environment and are not constantly moving around to different cities where things are constantly changing. I personally think that this is a great thing to do because it definitely feels like YOUR city, however I can see how some people may not like it because it definitely feels limiting, and it also makes the game lack a sense of diversity in the environments. Another thing that makes this story much more personal is the inclusion of family, which does in fact play a huge role in the story. The beginning of the story deals with Hawke trying to get his family safe, and throughout the game, you will become a champion of Kirkwall, plus your family grows and changes just as the character of Hawke does, and their actions depend very much on what you do throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story brings in many decisions that will invoke emotion, and some decisions will make you truly stop and think about the consequences that may occur. The thing that makes it even more incredible is that even from your very early decisions, you will feel like your decisions have a very significant impact on the world. There will be times where something bad might have happened, and you could have done something earlier to stop it from happening, and it makes you actually think about it. It is very well done, especially since the overall story of the game lacks direction. It truly feels like your story; a story that you the player craft. My personal story felt almost like a romance at parts because of a path I decided to take with a certain companion, and it amazed me at how the story shifted to allow that. It is even more amazing because I know somebody who played through the game without that companion at all, and in mine, that companion was almost integral to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story spans 10 years and is separated into three acts, each of which ends in a major event that will affect the city in a big way. The problem is, however, that there isn't really an overarching story that ties the three acts together. The only thing that really ties them together is the rank in the city that Hawke grows as time progresses, and there are times where you might feel like you don't remember why you are doing some of the things you are doing. It may get irritating at times, but it never affected me so much that I wanted to stop playing. Part of what helps that is the number and quality of awesome side quests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four types of quests in the game. There is Main Plot quests, Secondary Quests, Companion Quests, and Side Quests. Main plot quests are the line of quests that will make you proceed through the story throughout the three acts. These quests usually bring an important plot point into your mind, however there are times where you may not be exactly sure how it affects the story. Rest assured, you will find out eventually, and when you do, you will be happy you did so. Next up is Secondary Quests, which is an interesting animal. Many of the Secondary Quests are simply "go there, do this, come back" quests, however every once in a while, there is a Secondary Quest that has a plot that is very intriguing, and you will want to see them through until the end. Next up are Companion Quests, which are certainly the best side quests in the game, assuming that you interact with your companions. Each companion you have has their own unique back-story, and the many of the Companion Quests that you do involve that specific companion's back-story. Doing these quests not only gives you an interesting plot, each of which you will want to see through until the end, but they also further your relationship with that character, romantic or not. Last and certainly least are Side Quests, which essentially are quests in which there are things that you can find along the way, and if you find all of them, you can go back and claim a reward. It is definitely the weakest of the quests, so much so that I didn't complete a single Side Quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of companions, lets talk about the romances with companions. You will encounter a multitude of companions, each of which you have an opportunity to engage romantically with. Much to the game's credit, unlike the first game, some of the companions that you have the opportunity to have sex with in the game are characters that you would actually WANT to have sex with, regardless of the player's sexuality. I don't know how BioWare did it, but they managed to make each of these characters very interesting and compelling, and they also make you think before you act because there can be times where if you do something wrong, the companion can leave, sometimes for good. One thing about the characters that I did not like, however, is that throughout the game, there will be a number of characters that you can choose to either save or let die. Being a "good" character (which I will get to later), I saved all that I came across. The problem, however, is that near the end of the game, there are parts where many of the characters you interacted with and saved come back, and you are almost expected to remember all of them and what you did for them. This is very frustrating to me because I didn't remember many of them, especially since there are characters in the game that look very similar, almost to the point that you cannot differentiate two different characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought the story was excellent. The characters in it are incredible, especially the ones that return from the first game (Enchantments anyone?). It may be very different than that of the first, but in a way, it had to be, because if it was just another "the end of the world is coming" story, players might have felt D&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu and may not have seen it all the way through. With this, however, I wanted to see how the game would end, which is a huge credit to the game. Another credit to the game is that it stops you from playing either a completely good or a completely bad character as many RPGs nowadays allow you to do, even more so than the original Dragon Age. You may think you are doing a good thing, but it can easily turn into something bad, and there are consequences to everything. This is a great thing to see, as many times in games you choose the good dialog option because you want to be the good guy or vice versa for evil, but this game can preclude you from doing that very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GAMEPLAY 9.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much has been made about the gameplay in Dragon Age II. People have been saying that it was dumbed down for consoles. People have also been saying that it is now too easy. As a PC gamer who didn't mind the Dragon Age Origins combat but also didn't think it was anything exceptional I personally I think that the revamp for gameplay is a large leap forward. It looks much more fluid, it is not nearly as clunky as the first, and each time an enemy explodes in blood by your hand, it is immensely satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Dragon Age, the whole idea of the combat in Dragon Age is the traditional Baulder's Gate tradition of party combat and pausing the game and micro-managing each party member. The sequel is no different, except that they simplified many things that needed simplifying. The new spells and special abilities you gain each level has been simplified to multiple families of spells, each of which the player can choose to specialize in. Each family has more or less than five spells, each of which can also be upgraded. Through the course of the game, you will level up enough to completely fill up about two of those families of your choice, which makes you actually feel like you are doing things you truly want to do. Also returning are the six attributes that you can put points in as you level. It works exactly like it did in the first game, however the sequel does a much better job at showing you what you will benefit in when you put a point in a certain attribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of you hardcore players out there, don't you worry: the difficulty in this game is perfectly fine. They made they curve for the Normal difficulty easier so more people can play on Normal (which is what I played on), however even on Normal there were many parts where I died and had to retry. The Hardcore and Nightmare difficulties have also returned for all of you crazy players who can handle that, a feat I personally have no intentions of completing. It is, however, there for anyone who wishes to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that I very much disliked about Dragon Age II's combat, and that is the removal of the top-down view. BioWare's excuse for this was that they couldn't put roofs on the buildings, and therefore it took out many of their design ideas. I for one believe, however, that this is no excuse. There are many times where there are a multitude of enemies in which I needed a much greater view on what is happening, something that I couldn't do. Also, as a mage, there were times where I needed to cast Area of Effect spells on a certain area. However, because you cannot see as well, when you are casting spells on a sloped area, your vision is blinded in such a way that you cannot tell if you are hitting what you want to hit. It can be very frustrating at times, however did not at all diminish my enjoyment of the game in any significant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOUND 9.75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound in this game, like Dragon Age Origins and just about every other BioWare game, is spectacular. The score does a very impressive job at conveying the mood, and it fits just right in those epic scenes that either makes you feel like a true badass, or makes you feel vulnerable as it makes you feel emotion when it wants you to. The voice acting in the game is also spectacular. There is the occasional voice that is not good (for lack of a better term), but the majority of the characters are voiced incredibly. Each character has a voice that truly sells you on the character, especially the main character Hawke, who is now fully voiced unlike in the first game. This has also caused a fair bit of controversy with the hardcore community, as many of them felt that the lack of voice in the main character allowed the player to fill in that voice with whatever they want, like one would do in Link or Metroid. I, however, thought that it was completely out of place, especially with the full voice support of all of BioWare's other games, and am glad that they saw that and voiced him or her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of what makes the voice acting so spectacular is the sheer number of possible dialog options in the game. Each dialog option leads to its own response, and all of these have great voice acting. Much has also been made of the dialog system in this game, as it is definitely more like Mass Effect in that you have usually three options: one is good, one is humorous, and one is bad. In this, however, each dialog option has an icon next to it so that you will know what the tone of your character will be. In short, you will know if you are flirting or not. Another "Mass Effect" feature is the addition of a summarized text option. Each dialog option is basically a summarization of what Hawke is trying to say. There were some times in which I felt differently than how I wanted to be, however much of the time the thing Hawke actually said is actually how I was feeling. I feel like this is much improved to the purely text-based dialog system of Dragon Age Origins, which was definitely impressive, but it just didn't fit for the kind of game BioWare was aiming on making in Dragon Age II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRAPHICS 8.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphics in the game are great, speaking for the PC, especially with the High-Res textures. It's no Crysis 2, but it's not trying to be. The art style seems much different, as it is trying much less to be realistic as the first one was. Instead, it seems almost cartoony, so much so that the some of the character designs reminded me of the Sims, except that I can actually understand what the people in Dragon Age II are saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that everyone can understand is the amount of blood in this game, yet they may not be able to believe how much is in this game. If Dragon Age Origins was a 9 on a scale of 1-10 of blood, Dragon Age II is a 14. It gets brutal. Every time you kill an enemy, no matter if you are using a sword or magic, the NPC explodes into blood and the body parts fall apart onto the floor. It makes the combat much more satisfying when you hit somebody and they explode. Something that also makes its glorious return is the inclusion of blood on characters during dialog scenes. You can turn it off it you want, but I always get a kick out of having a totally serious conversation while covered in blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one disappointment I had with the graphics, and its not necessarily the graphics themselves so much as the map that BioWare created for this game, was the reuse of assets. BioWare is known for reusing assets, but Dragon Age II brings that to a whole new level. The most noticeable of this is the reuse of the same four or five dungeons in the game. There are about five different maps that you go through as dungeons, but they are repeated over and over again, with no differences at all in architecture. The only differences are that sometimes certain doors are closed. All of this would be somewhat bearable if BioWare bothered to get rid of the map of the area you can't even go to in that specific dungeon. There will be a door there that you are unable to open, but if you look on the map, the road is still there, which many times made me think that was the way I was supposed to go. It was very frustrating at times, and it definitely made the game feel rushed, which is so surprising given how fooled one could be when thinking about how much time was actually spent developing this game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPLAYABILITY 9.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of Dragon Age II has been an interesting thing to talk about. I have talked to a couple of people who said that the game took the 40 hours or so to complete. Others I have talked to say that it took them 15-20 hours. I personally did almost every side quest, save for a couple that I deliberately skipped, and I listened to all of the conversations, and it took me just over 20 hours to complete. This is a shocker, as in the first Dragon Age; side quests alone could easily fill up 50 hours. The difference in this game, however, is that I feel like there are so many different ways that one can go through those 20 hours I played that it is definitely worth replaying at least once, if not twice or three times. The thing about the Dragon Age series that is awesome as well is that you can also go through the first game again and import a different world each time. I personally didn't import a save from the Origins because of a hard drive error, but I can definitely see myself going through Origins again and importing the save into Dragon Age II and completely changing my play style to see all the different possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL 8.75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth and remembering how long it took them to make it, Dragon Age II is an incredible achievement. They managed to create an engaging story in less than half the time it took BioWare to make the first Dragon Age, not even counting the fact that they had to make DLC for the first one as well. As for the game itself, had it not been connected to the Dragon Age name and the BioWare name, it would easily be an incredible game. The conversations are staggering, the combat is amazingly fun, and the story and side quests are very entertaining. However, because it is a BioWare developed Dragon Age game, it has to be put up to the same standards as the first one, in terms of quality and also mechanics. I feel like too many of the mechanics were changed to be called a true Dragon Age game. It is a game in which all of its separate parts are great, but there is something that holds the collective hole back from greatness if you have played the original Dragon Age. Having said that, if you can look past the Dragon Age name, you will find a great RPG that will engross you and leave you begging for more.</text>
