          assert batchClassification.simpleClassify("For the 'TLDR' crowd DA2 isn't a *bad* game per se, it's just very rushed and often schizophrenic about what kind of game it wants to be. Fans of Origins in particular will want to be wary, but even newcomers should give the demo a try and probably wait for it to go on sale. It likely won't take longer than a month or two, so you won't have to wait long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone else wanting a bit more detail...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many, many fans of Dragon Age: Origins have lamented that a more appropriate title for it's divisive sequel would be 'Mass Dragon Effect 2.' I disagree, as aside from the new conversation wheel the two have very little in common. Dragon Age 2 is, in many ways, far more similar to another title of Bioware's: the often forgotten Jade Empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Jade Empire, DA2 is a console-focused RPG with much of the choices stripped out, shallow party members you don't interact with much, a set protagonist with a set background, an almost completely linear story, and features a combat system with a bent towards action RPGs/button mashers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Jade Empire, DA2 is the sequel to a game that was the opposite of all of that and doesn't have the strong overarching story, pivotal decision moment, and detailed art design of Jade Empire to back it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've spent a significant amount of time with DA2 across two different playthroughs in an attempt to be fair and try to understand some of the changes. My first game was as a DPS warrior on Nightmare, I finished the game with all the non-fetch quest (we'll get to that soon) side quests done in 32 hours. My second playthrough was as a mage with healer leanings due to my loathing of a certain party member on Normal, also with all of the quests done, in 22 hours. Act 3 of the second run was incredibly hard for me to get through, not because of difficulty but due to my own boredom. I have no urge whatsoever to replay the game anytime soon. That should speak for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute worst part of DA2 is how it shows the sign of a rushed development in nearly every facet. Music and codex entries from DA:O and it's DLC have been reused, environments and locations are reused over and over and over again, environments in general are nearly barren and devoid of things to interact with, and there is a surprising amount of purely filler fetch quests to try and pad the amount of content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of locations, I felt like I spent 80% of the time in Kirkwall, 10% of the time in Reused Dungeon X (Beach Dungeon/Cave Dungeon/Sewer Dungeon/Catacomb Dungeon), 1% of the time in the Deep Roads (much of which was reused for the Catacomb Dungeon), and 9% of the time staring at loading screens as I fast traveled between Kirkwall and Reused Dungeon X. The reused dungeons are a huge problem, anyone that is trying to dismiss it as a minor fault is underplaying it. You *will* get utterly sick of seeing the Wounded Coast and Sundermount tilesets to the point you simply don't want to play anymore. Nearly every side quest in the game takes place in these reused locations, and the game is almost entirely made up *of* side quests. They were reused so overtly that the map wasn't even edited, you'll see areas where the dungeon continues but you can't actually access due to suspiciously placed rocks or non-interactive doors or -- and I am not exaggerating -- INVISIBLE WALLS. When Hawke ran uselessly against an invisible wall in one of the repeated areas I exited the game in disgust and didn't come back to it until a few days later. It really is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirkwall isn't much better, and even has one of it's districts reused for a tileset, as it is nearly barren. Streets and important buildings are practically empty with only motionless non-interactive, largely silent NPCs loitering about amongst the occasional vendor or the rare quest NPC. For the ones that do speak when you walk by, they are shockingly repetitive. DA2 takes place over a span of 10 years, and yet the loitering crowds barely change. There will always be that one NPC in the Keep that bemoans not being able to see the Viscount for the entire game, even after a certain event in Act 2 that makes that line completely bizarre. You will quickly memorize who says what when you walk by them. This wouldn't be so bad if Kirkwall was just one of several major locations you spent the game in, like DA:O's Denerim, but this is literally the ONLY major location. At night the streets are even emptier and you will instead find the occasional spawn of enemy thugs/mercs instead, another blatant sign of being rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember back to when you played Mass Effect 1 and how sick you were of the reused cave/bunker map for it's side quests. Now imagine if the game was gutted of it's major quest hubs and you were forced to stay on the Citadel the entire game, complete with loading screens for the different districts instead of elevators, and fast traveled to those caves and bunkers for every single side quest. You now have a pretty good idea of what DA2 is like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DA2's main plot is a very, very slow starter that depends on side quests for almost all of Act 1 and 2 to fill it out. By the time it picks up at the end of Act 2 it's too late, and you're stumbling your way to the ending and realizing just how utterly linear the game is with a sense of \"That's it?!\" before you know it. The side quests themselves have the occasional high point, but for the most part they're quite simplified compared to DA:O with superficial choices at best and at worst they're little more than MMO fetch quests. This is largely due to the dialogue wheel and voiced protagonist, it's simply impossible to have the amount of ways DA:O had to solve quests with all the dialogue recorded for both a male and female Hawke. Unfortunately this means there is often only two (blatantly good or naive vs blatantly evil or practical) solutions for each quest, with the rare third option usually depending on what companions you've brought along. Even those third options can be deceptive and can result in one of the two good/bad results anyway. The consequences for these decisions have also been almost completely removed, especially in regards to how party members react. There is exactly one side quest that causes companions to turn on you (it's forced, nothing you say/no amount of friendship can stop it from happening, and it's only temporary), one companion quest that can result in that companion never coming back, and two forced main story events that can result in losing a companion each (one of which requires the prior companion coming back only to be sent away again). This is a far cry from how DA:O handled quest decisions and companion reactions. Now the worst that can happen is you'll earn Rival points if you do something completely against what that companion stands for. Lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your character in general is so much worse than DA:O as well. Dialogue suffers from the change to the wheel, often having \"What? Why did Hawke say THAT?\" moments even with the new 'emotion' icons. One of the few interesting additions to DA2 was the way Hawke's non-wheel lines would change in tone depending on what you've chosen before, so a snarky Hawke would be more inclined to be flippant or an aggressive/jerk Hawke would be more likely to behave as a jerk when you're not picking the lines yourself. This is hampered by the fact that Hawke is, in general, a complete jerk. The snarky \"funny\" lines tend to not be funny at all and even if you pick the \"nice/peaceful\" option all the time every time, Hawke will still spout incredibly inane/idiotic things when you're not in control. And that's the thing about Hawke, you're never in control. You're given a backstory right at the start, with a family you're supposed to care about, but nothing tangible in game to *make* you care about Hawke's personal story. So something tragic happens to Hawke's family member and one of two things happens: A.) Hawke will say something absurdly stupid (this is easily seen in the demo at a certain point, but it isn't the only time) causing a disconnect between the player and their character or B.) Hawke reacts emotionally but the player doesn't care due to the lack of development and is, again, disconnected. Hawke is never YOUR Hawke the way Shepard became YOUR Shepard in Mass Effect, instead it's on level with Jade Empire foisting Dawn Star on you as your best friend at the beginning. The character is incredibly bland and you never form any kind of emotional attachment to her, but you can never actually make her leave no matter how much of a jerk you are. She's just kind of *there.* So when Surprising Plot Revelation Y comes around you simply shrug while your character reacts much less ambivalently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The companions fair slightly better than Hawke/Hawke's family does, but they're well below DA:O and Mass Effect standards. With the exception of Varric, they're stereotypes that are given little to no depth or just poorly written in general. Isabela is the stereotypical flirty hot video game chick that provides innuendo in banter, her only development (aside from her bust line from DA:O to DA2) is whether she's only slightly selfish or morally bankrupt selfish. Merril is supposed to be similar to Tali as the geeky/adorable character, but comes off as incredibly childish and frankly stupid. This is especially true in her companion quest, which was so obviously a bad idea with no real way to change the ending short of not accepting the quest that it's frustrating; the end to her quest also highlights just how bad the dialogue wheel's summary misrepresents what you actually say in an awful two-for-one representation of what's wrong with DA2. Fenris is a Broody Elf(tm) that stays a Broody Elf(tm) and seems to be inspired by the worst of anime and the Twilight series mushed together into a video game character, though his storyline at least had some promise before it's abrupt ending. Anders loses all of his often bizarre cheer from DA:Awakening and becomes an angry, ranty, obsessive plot device. Aveline is the stereotypical paragon/Knight character, and is as inoffensive but uninteresting as Jacob (\"the priiiiiiiiize\" romance aside) was from Mass Effect 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There simply isn't a character as interesting as Alistair or Morrigan or Shale or Leliana in DA2, and they never develop as much either. This is especially disappointing because Hawke has known these characters for 10 *years* by the end of the game vs your Warden traveling with the original crew for a single year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much has been made of the combat, and I can really only nod my head in agreement to a point. Nightmare is genuinely hard, but it's hard for the wrong reasons. The game has been balanced around the console gameplay of \"Push the A button and Awesome happens!\" leaving you with little room for party makeup. You *must* take Aveline as she is the only tank companion or make Hawke a tank as the 2-hander tanking that worked in Hard won't cut it. You *must* take Anders as he is the only companion that has heal spells or make Hawke a healer mage. With Anders this forces you down a certain story path in Act 3, leaving one of the few choices in the game as a non-choice. In DA:O I could have Alistair or Shale or even Dog tank and I could have Wynne or spec Morrigan to heal. I wasn't forced to make my character a tank/healer or take a character I hated and forced to make a plot decision due to the difficulty level I was playing on. This is because the game is balanced around having NO tank and NO healer and simply popping potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the reason why there is no overhead camera or freeform camera, making the placement of AoEs with friendly fire on utterly frustrating. This is the reason why enemies come in magical, teleporting waves every fight, so console players won't get overwhelmed and be forced to swap to a character other than Hawke whilst Nightmare players have a group of enemies randomly spawn onto their mage and gib him. This is the reason why auto attack is borked (watch your selected melee character get knocked back or knock back whoever they were attacking and then stand there stupidly until you tell them to attack again), as auto attack was completely left out on the consoles. This is the reason why Hold Position is now a party wide toggle, so you can't individually tell your range not to move while allowing your melee to pursue. And so on and so on. On Casual and Normal the game is so easy they may as well just present a \"Skip Combat?\" option at the beginning of each encounter and simply give you the xp/loot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could write pages more to express my disappoint and where DA2 went wrong. The change in art style is irksome, as Darkspawn now look like Skeletor wannabes and Elves are hunchbacked skeletons with anime-huge eyes and weapons are reaching Final Fantasy levels of ridiculousness. Companion armor being locked serves no purpose as it's not simplified, you still need to swap out belts/amulets/rings/some weapons, it was solely to cut down on the number of models they had to make for the armor. The friendship/rivalry system is frustrating due to it's limitations. The story was especially disappointing, but it's hard to get into why it's so disappointing without giving out spoilers. In the end if you really like RPGs and in particular really like Bioware RPGs, you'll find something to like. It's just a matter of how much it's worth to you and how long you're willing to wait to play it. Myself, I wish I had waited for the inevitable Ultimate Edition to go on sale for \$10 or so. Bioware games were amongst the few games I'd be willing to pay \$60 for and pre-order, but that's no longer the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRM note - There has been a lot of bickering and confusion over what, exactly, DA2 comes with. Some claim that SecuROM was used and installed, others say it only used the Release Control functionality and left behind inert files. Suffice to say, if DRM is a huge concern do some research and read through the thread on the Bioware Social forums. Mine didn't install anything extra on my PC before I completely uninstalled the game, but outside of that I have no idea.") == 2.0
          assert batchClassification.simpleClassify("I'm not sure if anyone else shares this opinion, but I just feel that Bioware RPGs are becoming less and less RPGish with time.  I still think that NVWN and KOTOR are some of the best RPGs ever made.  DAO and Mass Effect are also great games.  But it seems that the games are progressively becoming worse with every new installment.  Their games are just turning into carbon copies of eachother, simplest example is to look at the characters between ME2 and DAOII. Is there really a difference between Tali and Merril? Its almost same exact storylines but the names are different... to me that just shows laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this game goes, the few things that really bothered me:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Why cant it have been set in the same place immediately after the blight? It would have been very interesting to play a game where some sort of power struggle among the survivors to be a central issue, and involving the Wardens... how they could make a DA game without wardens is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Dont think that there is a map to travel in, or different cities to visit, its ONE city with different quarters that are more or less the same.  I felt that I played the same maps OVER AND OVER AND OVER, dungeons are mostly identical and very repetitive down to the foes you face and the location you face them in.  I can count on one hand the different types of enemies... 90% of what you kill is spiders, one or two kind of deamons and skeletons, and maybe some humans who ALL dress the same out in the city nights.  The game made me feel very clausterphobic, I felt cooped up inside the walls of this one city, with very little variation in scenery.  There is no travel or a camp where all your companions can be located. I had to constantly jump from one companion home to another to interact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Loot was the worst, your companions wear their own armor so that means if you were a warrior, you will vendor 80% of the armor you find and you will never know what it looks like because your companions dont wear it!  There was really no quests in the game for any sort of special armor or weapon, I changed my armor a grand total of 3 times during the 38 hours of gametime, it went like this: Dragon armor (same one you get in the first one) to Stone-something or other set then to Champion armor... I vendored everything else that I found.  There is no smith in the game, (or none that I found) which is amazing to me that a city that HUGE has no damn shops in it, everything you buy from stalls. So there is absolutely no custom crafting in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Characters: They used the same formula of character interaction as the expansion, you cant really interact with your characters other than when you are ALLOWED to interact with them.  Most of the time I didn't want to interact because I honestly hated every follower.  Their personalities were thin, predictable and uninteresting.  There is no Leliana to sing you a sweet song, no Morrigan to break your heart, no Allistair to annoy you, yes, I actually missed Allistair (and I would have had him killed if I had an option in the first game).  They also effectively killed the romance aspect of the game, which is a shame but no big loss if they compensated for it with some interesting interactions, in which they did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The combat was stupidly simplified... I literally activated 4-5 things during combat and had 2 sustained abilities on... THATS IT.  Answer this for me please... why cant a warrior duel wield?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The ending was completely unmemorable... the Sopranos has a more meaningful ending than this game.  Unlike DAO, there was no list of consequences to your actions, so whatever decisions you made in the game, you will just have to guess as to the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other things that was wrong with this game, Im sure someone here mentioned some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no interest in buying any DLC for this game, because no matter how much glitter you put on a piece of crap, its still crap. I don't feel that any DLC will add anything of value to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed that its actually upsetting and I wont make the mistake of buying Bioware games on release dates (like I usually do) from now on.") == 2.0
          assert batchClassification.simpleClassify("I have to say that in many, many ways I'm really disappointed.  The \"big\" elements in this had great potential--but as they say, the devil is in the details and I think Bioware fails completely on that score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Combat - The combat on a larger scale is great--its smoother and more fluid.  You can do things more rapidly.  On the downside, your characters are very much \"locked\" into their roles and depending on what you start out with you--you can end up totally stuck.  For example--unless you are a mage, the only person who can be a true healer is Anders.  You can't do the \"revive a party member\" or \"group heal\" without him or without being a mage yourself. You also are going to lose some characters (if not indefinitely) at least for certain stretches of the game and you can miss a couple of them if you don't do every random \"secondary\" quest.  My first go round I had ONE non-ranged melee character--ONE for a huge portion of the game.  God bless Aveline but I've never been a fan of sword and shield so she got boring after awhile.  The only rogue you have access to that isn't an archer is Isabela and she's problematic later on in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Armor -- My first playthrough I made the mistake of not actually reading the stupid booklet that came with the game and it took me forever to realize that about 75% of the armor is useless and any armor you pick up can only be used on your character.  That makes looting so much less fun and finding the random upgrade slots for your characters is incredibly anti-climactic.  I think this was laziness on the programming side--Bioware probably didn't want to have to adjust all the cutscenes to show your characters in the various armor.  That shortcut took a lot out of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The Interface -- oh sweet jesus do I HATE the ability trees.  They are so annoying and it takes forever to navigate through them and compare things.  Were the solid straightforward squares just too easy for us that Bioware had to make it more confusing for no apparent reason?  I also find the inventory as not all that much improved.  There is just less stuff to hold onto because of the aforementioned armor issue.  I really would have loved an interface that lets you see (and distribute) gear to all your characters at once--not just people in your party--or at least see what you have equipped on all your characters even if they weren't in your group at the time.  This would have been a huge improvement and made it easier to choose what charms to sell or hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Environment. -- All the caves, mansions, tunnels--they all look exactly the same.  The only difference in one cave to another is that it will allow you to open X door and then not Y door.  It's very hard to stay interested in the environment when you spend almost all the game in one city.  They should have taken a little more time to put in a few details here and there in the different settings to set them apart.  Maybe just change the coloring of the walls or some of the layout.  You also spend a lot of time just walking from point A to point B and I hate having to visit every character in their own \"home base\".  The game lost a lot in not having a place where you could have all the characters come together--like the camp from Origins.  I think the game would have benefited greatly from having a sort of meeting place for the characters--like the pub.  It would have opened up lots of interactions and interesting gameplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Characters and Dialogue.  Death to the conversation wheel!  Death!  I hate the fact that what you choose has only a vague resemblance to what you actually say.  And while the stupid little picture gives you a clue--the tone is often questionable.  What was wrong with Origins dialogue?  You choose something and...gasp...you actually say that.  I completely miss the gifts option--it was sort of like a mini game and it really helped you understand the companions' personalities and gave them another dimension.  I'm on my second playthrough and I still don't quite have a lock on some of the personality preferences.  I also think Bioware really skimped on the romance cutscenes and options.  I'm still angry on how poorly they wrote Anders.  While he has every reason to be very \"changed\" from Awakenings, there's almost none of the light-hearted guy who carried \"Ser-Pounce-A-Lot\" around.  If you played Awakenings, you'd expect Anders to like the funny dialogue options, even if he's all tortured and nuts...but he doesn't.  I don't see the point in bringing characters from the previous lore if you are going to disregard their history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  The story.  Ah, the story as a whole--the big picture *could* be interesting and compelling--it *could* have been epic.  And it should have involved lots and lots of magic.  But alas, no.  The problem is that the quests never come together and there are tons of missed opportunities.  There really aren't any epic quests (although you fight dragons frequently enough that you'll get bored with them).  The one quest that stands out involves Hawke's mother which is the most interesting (and personal) of the entire game.  It has a big tie in at at the end but only if you pay intense attention.  Just playing up that angle alone would have made the game extremelymore personal. The quests and character interaction don't even have a shadow of the richness as those in the first game.  Bioware also went a little overboard with trying to force concepts to seem \"gray\" because some plot points came across as illogical and extremely ill-fitting.  Characters don't behave logically nor do people behave particularly logically toward you. There will come a time where you really don't feel like either side deserves your help.  Not the outcome you want after hours of gameplay and certainly not one that makes you feel anything like a \"champion\".") == 2.0
          assert batchClassification.simpleClassify("Lots of reviewers here will have played the original game. They loved it to death, most of them(I cringed when I had to defeat a dragon when I first began but the politics, 'choice realism' and emotional impact helped make it so much more believable). It's like their first relationship. They are so stuck with what they like about the first game that when Bioware says the second is getting a different approach, it's as if they heard 'yes we will never be different for any reason'. On the other hand there's nothing I can say that justifies Bioware's decision to rush it. Now they want to break up with the franchise. If you haven't played Dragon Age: Origins and you want to play this first, you are indeed fortunate, because DA:O doesn't do anything to prepare you for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let's get to the main point: worth buying BUT not before you accept that it's not meant to be the DA:O you played before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some general things reviewers on a lot of websites have been saying and my counterpoints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Story approach and pacing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers would say: I hate that there's no clear objective in DA2, I'm just moving from one meaningless quest to the next! DA:O had that! Only the last act made sense! I got epilogues in DA:O why the hell not in here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) My counterpoint: From what I see, this Bioware team has got some people who are extremely gifted in the subtlety of storytelling and I mean that as a compliment. Before I go into the rest of this section I want to state that this game is as rich in story subtlety as the last one if not richer. It has so much going on at one time that it will be sometime before you can keep up with the pacing. It will get better once you begin playing the second time around, you will begin to see how the plot was right there from the start. Sure it took awhile to begin unfolding it but it made that 2nd play through all the more sweeter. Remember to explore everyone, everything, everywhere at every stage of the game. Don't rush yourselves through this or you will lose out important bits of \"non-quest\" info that shape the story profoundly. This will be like getting a new 'acquired taste'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the idea of a 7 year account of my character in just one city as told by an interrogated dwarf sounded cheesy to me before the release. But I noticed from the first playthrough that Bioware took painstaking effort in crafting out the options of a poor Fereldan refugee trying to make it in a city with a slave driven past. Once you accept that as part of the overall game design, then it will cease to be such a major pain. Most people will complain about the dialogue options being dumbed down but they don't know that you can get away with lying and end up getting someone jobless because of it (and this someone then makes an interesting reappearance towards the end of the game). Only one disappointment in the story towards the end but not enough to turn you off completely from finishing it once. Also one group that keeps attacking you randomly was left out of the story. I was expecting the game to be a lot worse than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just let go of DA:O baggage I bet you will get excited for the next one. The last cameo in the final cutscene was something I found especially masterful. I cannot believe that I have to be waiting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Level Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers would say: So repetitive and boring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) My counterpoint: I don't have much of one. You will be going to one particular location over and over again and it has winding paths everywhere. I got really sick and tired that the map couldn't scroll or be resized to help me see my plot marker more clearly. Then there are series of levels that look like the same one you have seen before in earlier quests. Definitely one of the casualties of a shortened development timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Companions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers: Boring, too linear, shallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Counterpoint: Depends on whether you are still carrying DA:O baggage with you into this game or not. From the way I see it, they are already driven by their own convictions and have their own pasts to deal with and these add to the richness of the game. They resemble a lot of us jaded, hardened adults. This is a game where the character has to pick a side when both sides clearly have their own hypocritical aspects. Most people won't like having to do so when the option to be absolutely neutral is not given. However, the story of this game is to show how a conflict in one city is impacting the rest of the world a la prequel for the 3rd installment. Once you get that into your head, it will be more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Battle, armor and potion/rune making&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Reviewers: Stupid Bioware left out my tactical window. Made battles too nice looking, as in not worth counting. Hate the new inability to switch companion armor. Hate the new crafting choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Counterpoint: I side with all the frustrated and hurt people who did not get to keep the tactical battle view. Though the new tactical view is suffient, it's just by a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I would consider the battle to be a visual improvement stylewise. Morrigan and Wynne were always doing the same one or two poses for every spell I used. The mages fighting style with their staffs still looks a little cheesy in one or two aspects but the rest are between 'over the top but it grows on me' to 'yeah nicer than DA:O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability tree has been redesigned for mostly better because it now includes abilities just for your companions, and reliant on your relationship with them. I also like that some abilities from DA:O like Sunder Armor and Sunder Arms have been simplified to just Sunder. And I find that the ability upgrades make point spending here interesting. I think spell combos are no longer part of this; I miss not having it like last time. I like how persuasion has been left up to the character's dialogue choices so that you can focus on spending points on your fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who liked the \"Andraste Bridge\" puzzle of DA:O will be disappointed to know its all hack and slash meet ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The companion armor is something of a convenience for me (I'm lazy that way). The ones they have from the middle of the game onwards are better than the ones sold in the stores. Miss seeing how different armor makes the characters look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i find making potions and runes in this game more convenient than before. I don't have to go and pick every hundred raw ingredients that will only add weight to my group's inventory just to keep for future use. But I do miss being able to make traps from DA:O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: Do you fork over your cash for this or not? If you are willing to let go of what DA:O meant to you in order to give this one a chance to prove itself you could be buying the most underrated game of this year. Maybe take some time to part with your impressions of DA:O before taking this next step. You don't need to rush into this like Bioware did but it will be rewarding once you open your heart to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P/s Bioware: If you resolve to take your time with DA3 and treat your writers well, you could be making the Sid Meier's Civilization of cRPG.") == 2.0
          assert batchClassification.simpleClassify("This is a world of tyrants and corruption. This is a world of many different races, and many poor opinions to those races. This is a world of magic and demons. This is the world of the Darkspawn and the Blight. This is the world of Dragon Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Dragon Age II, sequel to the immensely popular Dragon Age Origins of 2009. Developed by BioWare of the popular Mass Effect series and the upcoming Star Wars: The Old Republic, this game aims to follow up a game whose world immersed many players who could not get enough of the politically charged world of the Origins. However there have been many differences made in the 18 month development cycle that are getting many of the hardcore fans upset. Thankfully, while many things have changed, most of them are changes for the better, and they all add up an RPG that is different from the original, yet superb on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STORY 9.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Dragon Age II follows a male or female named Hawke, a Fereldan citizen fleeing from the Blight. Because this game takes place mostly right after the events of the first game, the Blight has been defeated throughout most of the game, and therefore Darkspawn are not your primary enemies. You do still fight Darkspawn occasionally, however they are far and few between, and because of such you are mostly fighting demons and human guards, mercenaries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the first Dragon Age was based almost entirely on the world it took place in, not as much as your character you played as. The sequel negates this idea by making it take place almost entirely in one city, which is the city of Kirkwall, which makes it much more personal because you are more familiar with your environment and are not constantly moving around to different cities where things are constantly changing. I personally think that this is a great thing to do because it definitely feels like YOUR city, however I can see how some people may not like it because it definitely feels limiting, and it also makes the game lack a sense of diversity in the environments. Another thing that makes this story much more personal is the inclusion of family, which does in fact play a huge role in the story. The beginning of the story deals with Hawke trying to get his family safe, and throughout the game, you will become a champion of Kirkwall, plus your family grows and changes just as the character of Hawke does, and their actions depend very much on what you do throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story brings in many decisions that will invoke emotion, and some decisions will make you truly stop and think about the consequences that may occur. The thing that makes it even more incredible is that even from your very early decisions, you will feel like your decisions have a very significant impact on the world. There will be times where something bad might have happened, and you could have done something earlier to stop it from happening, and it makes you actually think about it. It is very well done, especially since the overall story of the game lacks direction. It truly feels like your story; a story that you the player craft. My personal story felt almost like a romance at parts because of a path I decided to take with a certain companion, and it amazed me at how the story shifted to allow that. It is even more amazing because I know somebody who played through the game without that companion at all, and in mine, that companion was almost integral to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story spans 10 years and is separated into three acts, each of which ends in a major event that will affect the city in a big way. The problem is, however, that there isn't really an overarching story that ties the three acts together. The only thing that really ties them together is the rank in the city that Hawke grows as time progresses, and there are times where you might feel like you don't remember why you are doing some of the things you are doing. It may get irritating at times, but it never affected me so much that I wanted to stop playing. Part of what helps that is the number and quality of awesome side quests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four types of quests in the game. There is Main Plot quests, Secondary Quests, Companion Quests, and Side Quests. Main plot quests are the line of quests that will make you proceed through the story throughout the three acts. These quests usually bring an important plot point into your mind, however there are times where you may not be exactly sure how it affects the story. Rest assured, you will find out eventually, and when you do, you will be happy you did so. Next up is Secondary Quests, which is an interesting animal. Many of the Secondary Quests are simply \"go there, do this, come back\" quests, however every once in a while, there is a Secondary Quest that has a plot that is very intriguing, and you will want to see them through until the end. Next up are Companion Quests, which are certainly the best side quests in the game, assuming that you interact with your companions. Each companion you have has their own unique back-story, and the many of the Companion Quests that you do involve that specific companion's back-story. Doing these quests not only gives you an interesting plot, each of which you will want to see through until the end, but they also further your relationship with that character, romantic or not. Last and certainly least are Side Quests, which essentially are quests in which there are things that you can find along the way, and if you find all of them, you can go back and claim a reward. It is definitely the weakest of the quests, so much so that I didn't complete a single Side Quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of companions, lets talk about the romances with companions. You will encounter a multitude of companions, each of which you have an opportunity to engage romantically with. Much to the game's credit, unlike the first game, some of the companions that you have the opportunity to have sex with in the game are characters that you would actually WANT to have sex with, regardless of the player's sexuality. I don't know how BioWare did it, but they managed to make each of these characters very interesting and compelling, and they also make you think before you act because there can be times where if you do something wrong, the companion can leave, sometimes for good. One thing about the characters that I did not like, however, is that throughout the game, there will be a number of characters that you can choose to either save or let die. Being a \"good\" character (which I will get to later), I saved all that I came across. The problem, however, is that near the end of the game, there are parts where many of the characters you interacted with and saved come back, and you are almost expected to remember all of them and what you did for them. This is very frustrating to me because I didn't remember many of them, especially since there are characters in the game that look very similar, almost to the point that you cannot differentiate two different characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought the story was excellent. The characters in it are incredible, especially the ones that return from the first game (Enchantments anyone?). It may be very different than that of the first, but in a way, it had to be, because if it was just another \"the end of the world is coming\" story, players might have felt D&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu and may not have seen it all the way through. With this, however, I wanted to see how the game would end, which is a huge credit to the game. Another credit to the game is that it stops you from playing either a completely good or a completely bad character as many RPGs nowadays allow you to do, even more so than the original Dragon Age. You may think you are doing a good thing, but it can easily turn into something bad, and there are consequences to everything. This is a great thing to see, as many times in games you choose the good dialog option because you want to be the good guy or vice versa for evil, but this game can preclude you from doing that very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GAMEPLAY 9.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much has been made about the gameplay in Dragon Age II. People have been saying that it was dumbed down for consoles. People have also been saying that it is now too easy. As a PC gamer who didn't mind the Dragon Age Origins combat but also didn't think it was anything exceptional I personally I think that the revamp for gameplay is a large leap forward. It looks much more fluid, it is not nearly as clunky as the first, and each time an enemy explodes in blood by your hand, it is immensely satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Dragon Age, the whole idea of the combat in Dragon Age is the traditional Baulder's Gate tradition of party combat and pausing the game and micro-managing each party member. The sequel is no different, except that they simplified many things that needed simplifying. The new spells and special abilities you gain each level has been simplified to multiple families of spells, each of which the player can choose to specialize in. Each family has more or less than five spells, each of which can also be upgraded. Through the course of the game, you will level up enough to completely fill up about two of those families of your choice, which makes you actually feel like you are doing things you truly want to do. Also returning are the six attributes that you can put points in as you level. It works exactly like it did in the first game, however the sequel does a much better job at showing you what you will benefit in when you put a point in a certain attribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of you hardcore players out there, don't you worry: the difficulty in this game is perfectly fine. They made they curve for the Normal difficulty easier so more people can play on Normal (which is what I played on), however even on Normal there were many parts where I died and had to retry. The Hardcore and Nightmare difficulties have also returned for all of you crazy players who can handle that, a feat I personally have no intentions of completing. It is, however, there for anyone who wishes to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that I very much disliked about Dragon Age II's combat, and that is the removal of the top-down view. BioWare's excuse for this was that they couldn't put roofs on the buildings, and therefore it took out many of their design ideas. I for one believe, however, that this is no excuse. There are many times where there are a multitude of enemies in which I needed a much greater view on what is happening, something that I couldn't do. Also, as a mage, there were times where I needed to cast Area of Effect spells on a certain area. However, because you cannot see as well, when you are casting spells on a sloped area, your vision is blinded in such a way that you cannot tell if you are hitting what you want to hit. It can be very frustrating at times, however did not at all diminish my enjoyment of the game in any significant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOUND 9.75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound in this game, like Dragon Age Origins and just about every other BioWare game, is spectacular. The score does a very impressive job at conveying the mood, and it fits just right in those epic scenes that either makes you feel like a true badass, or makes you feel vulnerable as it makes you feel emotion when it wants you to. The voice acting in the game is also spectacular. There is the occasional voice that is not good (for lack of a better term), but the majority of the characters are voiced incredibly. Each character has a voice that truly sells you on the character, especially the main character Hawke, who is now fully voiced unlike in the first game. This has also caused a fair bit of controversy with the hardcore community, as many of them felt that the lack of voice in the main character allowed the player to fill in that voice with whatever they want, like one would do in Link or Metroid. I, however, thought that it was completely out of place, especially with the full voice support of all of BioWare's other games, and am glad that they saw that and voiced him or her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of what makes the voice acting so spectacular is the sheer number of possible dialog options in the game. Each dialog option leads to its own response, and all of these have great voice acting. Much has also been made of the dialog system in this game, as it is definitely more like Mass Effect in that you have usually three options: one is good, one is humorous, and one is bad. In this, however, each dialog option has an icon next to it so that you will know what the tone of your character will be. In short, you will know if you are flirting or not. Another \"Mass Effect\" feature is the addition of a summarized text option. Each dialog option is basically a summarization of what Hawke is trying to say. There were some times in which I felt differently than how I wanted to be, however much of the time the thing Hawke actually said is actually how I was feeling. I feel like this is much improved to the purely text-based dialog system of Dragon Age Origins, which was definitely impressive, but it just didn't fit for the kind of game BioWare was aiming on making in Dragon Age II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRAPHICS 8.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphics in the game are great, speaking for the PC, especially with the High-Res textures. It's no Crysis 2, but it's not trying to be. The art style seems much different, as it is trying much less to be realistic as the first one was. Instead, it seems almost cartoony, so much so that the some of the character designs reminded me of the Sims, except that I can actually understand what the people in Dragon Age II are saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that everyone can understand is the amount of blood in this game, yet they may not be able to believe how much is in this game. If Dragon Age Origins was a 9 on a scale of 1-10 of blood, Dragon Age II is a 14. It gets brutal. Every time you kill an enemy, no matter if you are using a sword or magic, the NPC explodes into blood and the body parts fall apart onto the floor. It makes the combat much more satisfying when you hit somebody and they explode. Something that also makes its glorious return is the inclusion of blood on characters during dialog scenes. You can turn it off it you want, but I always get a kick out of having a totally serious conversation while covered in blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one disappointment I had with the graphics, and its not necessarily the graphics themselves so much as the map that BioWare created for this game, was the reuse of assets. BioWare is known for reusing assets, but Dragon Age II brings that to a whole new level. The most noticeable of this is the reuse of the same four or five dungeons in the game. There are about five different maps that you go through as dungeons, but they are repeated over and over again, with no differences at all in architecture. The only differences are that sometimes certain doors are closed. All of this would be somewhat bearable if BioWare bothered to get rid of the map of the area you can't even go to in that specific dungeon. There will be a door there that you are unable to open, but if you look on the map, the road is still there, which many times made me think that was the way I was supposed to go. It was very frustrating at times, and it definitely made the game feel rushed, which is so surprising given how fooled one could be when thinking about how much time was actually spent developing this game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPLAYABILITY 9.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of Dragon Age II has been an interesting thing to talk about. I have talked to a couple of people who said that the game took the 40 hours or so to complete. Others I have talked to say that it took them 15-20 hours. I personally did almost every side quest, save for a couple that I deliberately skipped, and I listened to all of the conversations, and it took me just over 20 hours to complete. This is a shocker, as in the first Dragon Age; side quests alone could easily fill up 50 hours. The difference in this game, however, is that I feel like there are so many different ways that one can go through those 20 hours I played that it is definitely worth replaying at least once, if not twice or three times. The thing about the Dragon Age series that is awesome as well is that you can also go through the first game again and import a different world each time. I personally didn't import a save from the Origins because of a hard drive error, but I can definitely see myself going through Origins again and importing the save into Dragon Age II and completely changing my play style to see all the different possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL 8.75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth and remembering how long it took them to make it, Dragon Age II is an incredible achievement. They managed to create an engaging story in less than half the time it took BioWare to make the first Dragon Age, not even counting the fact that they had to make DLC for the first one as well. As for the game itself, had it not been connected to the Dragon Age name and the BioWare name, it would easily be an incredible game. The conversations are staggering, the combat is amazingly fun, and the story and side quests are very entertaining. However, because it is a BioWare developed Dragon Age game, it has to be put up to the same standards as the first one, in terms of quality and also mechanics. I feel like too many of the mechanics were changed to be called a true Dragon Age game. It is a game in which all of its separate parts are great, but there is something that holds the collective hole back from greatness if you have played the original Dragon Age. Having said that, if you can look past the Dragon Age name, you will find a great RPG that will engross you and leave you begging for more.") == 2.0
